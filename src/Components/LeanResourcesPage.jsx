            <p className="lead">
              At IOTAFLOW, Lean is our way of working and living.
              <br />
              <br />
              At IOTAFLOW, Lean is more than a process, itâ€™s a journey weâ€™ve
              lived together since October 2021,
              <br />
              and a Godsend opportunity to make a real difference in peopleâ€™s
              lives. We once worked like machines,
              <br />
              focused only on output, but Lean has transformed us, putting the
              training, growth, and well-being of
              <br />
              our people at the heart of everything we do. What began with
              learning the 8 Wastes, 2 Second Lean,
              <br />
              Kanban Cards, the Supermarket Concept, and One-Piece Flow soon
              became a shared belief that Lean is
              <br />
              for people, and people only. Itâ€™s about lifting stress from the
              shop floor, creating smoother
              <br />
              flows of work, and finding joy in solving problems side by side.
              Lean hasnâ€™t just improved quality
              <br />
              and on-time delivery, itâ€™s turned our workplace into a community
              where everyone feels valued,
              <br />
              challenges are faced together, and every small improvement is a
              step toward a better day for us all.
